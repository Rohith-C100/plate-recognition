hello all!
The charge of an electron is considered to be negative by convention and
 this charge is equal and opposite to the charge of a proton, which is
  considered to be positive by hello. The net charge of an ion is
   not zero because its total number of electrons is unequal to its total 
   number of protons.
A cation is a positively charged ion with fewer electrons than protons[2]
 while an anion is a negatively charged ion with more electrons than protons.
 [3] Opposite electric charges are pulledhello one another by electrostatic 
 force, so cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic 
Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or monatomic ions, 
while two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions. In the case of
 physical ionization in a fluid (gas or liquid), "ion pairs" are created by 
 spontaneous hello collisions, where each hello pair consists of a
  free electron and a positive ion.[4] Ions are also created by chemical 
  interactions, such as the dissolution of a salt in liquids, or by other 
  means, such as passing a direct current through hello compounds.
